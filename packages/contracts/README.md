## Architecture

The **Factory** deploys EIP-1167 minimal proxy clones of all three implementation contracts (AMM, Router, LP Token) per market via `CREATE2`. Deploy implementations once, then create unlimited markets through the factory.

```
Factory.createMarket(usdc, sigma_min)
  ├── deploys AMM proxy clone      (DELEGATECALL → AMM Implementation)
  ├── deploys Router proxy clone   (DELEGATECALL → Router Implementation)
  ├── deploys LP Token proxy clone (DELEGATECALL → LP Token Implementation)
  ├── initializes & wires all three:
  │     AMM ↔ Router (bidirectional)
  │     AMM → LP Token (mint/burn authority)
  │     AMM → USDC token
  │     AMM → sigma_min
  ├── LP Token owner = AMM proxy (set at initialization)
  └── transfers AMM + Router ownership to caller (two-step)
```

**LP Token Design:** Non-transferable ERC-20 (transfer/transferFrom disabled). Acts as a staking receipt for liquidity providers. Only the AMM proxy can mint/burn.

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features amm --release
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features router --release
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features lp-token --release
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features factory --release
```

---

## Test Commands

Unit tests live alongside each contract module (`#[cfg(test)]`) and run natively
on the host via the Stylus `TestVM` harness. Because every contract is its own
`#[entrypoint]`, only one contract module compiles per feature flag, so the
suite is run once per feature:

```bash
cargo +stable test --lib --features amm        # distribution_amm + math_core
cargo +stable test --lib --features router     # binary_router + math_core
cargo +stable test --lib --features lp-token   # lp_token + math_core
cargo +stable test --lib --features factory    # factory + math_core
```

> **Toolchain:** tests must be built with Rust **≥ 1.91** (e.g. `+stable`). The
> WASM contracts themselves still build on the pinned `1.88.0` toolchain in
> `rust-toolchain.toml`; only the dev-only `stylus-test` harness (and its alloy
> provider dependencies) require the newer compiler. `stylus-test` is declared
> under `[dev-dependencies]`, so it never enters the deployed WASM binary.

What's covered:

- **math_core** — WAD arithmetic, Gaussian PDF/CDF, `erf`, `exp_wad` saturation
  bounds, `sqrt_wad`, unit-range clamping, invalid-σ guards.
- **lp_token** — init/double-init, two-step ownership, owner-gated mint/burn,
  overflow & insufficient-balance reverts, non-transferability.
- **binary_router** — ownership, ERC-1155 surface (balances, approvals,
  `safeTransferFrom`, `supportsInterface`), deterministic `token_id` derivation,
  trade guards, a mocked happy-path buy, and the full settlement/claim/release
  branch logic.
- **distribution_amm** — ownership, parameter validation, `set_distribution`
  curve seeding, the stake-weighted `underwrite_trade` curve recompute (exact μ),
  the two-phase resolution timelock, collateral release, and fee distribution.
- **factory** — EIP-1167 creation-code bytes, CREATE2 salt distinctness, and a
  mocked `create_market` deploy/wire/record flow.

Cross-contract calls are exercised with `TestVM` mocks. Note that this version
of `TestVM` serves a single shared return-data buffer for all mocked calls (the
most-recently-registered mock's bytes); the tests are written around that.

The legacy Foundry mock tests remain runnable with `forge test`.

## Initial Deployment

Use the automated script or run manually:

### Automated

```bash
cd packages/contracts
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Manual

```bash
RPC_URL="https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc"
KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>

# 1. Deploy AMM Implementation

  --max-fee-per-gas-gwei 0.1

# 4. Deploy Factory

  --wasm-file target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/omnicurve_contracts.wasm \
  --max-fee-per-gas-gwei 0.1

# 5. Initialize factory with all 3 implementation addresses
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "initialize(address,address,address,address)" \
  <OWNER> <AMM_IMPL> <ROUTER_IMPL> <LP_TOKEN_IMPL> \
  --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# 6. Create first market
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "createMarket(address,int256)" \
  <USDC_ADDRESS> 100000000000000000 \
  --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# 7. Read proxy addresses
cast call <FACTORY> "getMarketAmm(uint256)(address)" 0 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call <FACTORY> "getMarketRouter(uint256)(address)" 0 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call <FACTORY> "getMarketLpToken(uint256)(address)" 0 --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# 8. Accept ownership on AMM and Router proxies
cast send <AMM_PROXY> "acceptOwnership()" --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast send <ROUTER_PROXY> "acceptOwnership()" --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

> **Note:** LP Token ownership does not need to be accepted — the AMM proxy is set as owner directly during `initialize()`.

---

## Creating Additional Markets

No new contract deployments needed. Each `createMarket` call deploys a fresh AMM + Router + LP Token proxy trio automatically.

### Step 1: Check current market count

```bash
cast call <FACTORY> "getMarketCount()(uint256)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

The returned value is the next `market_id` that will be assigned.

### Step 2: Create the market

```bash
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "createMarket(address,int256)" \
  <USDC_ADDRESS> <SIGMA_MIN_WAD> \
  --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

`SIGMA_MIN_WAD` is in 18-decimal WAD format. Common values:
- `100000000000000000` = 0.1 (reasonable default)
- `10000000000000000` = 0.01 (tight curve)
- `1000000000000000000` = 1.0 (wide curve)

### Step 3: Query the new proxy addresses

Replace `<MARKET_ID>` with the value from Step 1 (0, 1, 2, ...):

```bash
cast call <FACTORY> "getMarketAmm(uint256)(address)" <MARKET_ID> --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call <FACTORY> "getMarketRouter(uint256)(address)" <MARKET_ID> --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call <FACTORY> "getMarketLpToken(uint256)(address)" <MARKET_ID> --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Step 4: Accept ownership on AMM and Router proxies

The factory initiated a two-step ownership transfer. Finalize it:

```bash
cast send <AMM_PROXY> "acceptOwnership()" --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast send <ROUTER_PROXY> "acceptOwnership()" --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

> The LP Token proxy does **not** require ownership acceptance — the AMM proxy is already the owner from initialization.

### Step 5: Configure the market

Set the initial distribution before trading begins:

```bash
cast send <AMM_PROXY> "setDistribution(int256,int256)" <MU_WAD> <SIGMA_WAD> \
  --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

After this, LPs can `addLiquidity` and traders can `buyYes`/`buyNo` through the Router proxy.

## Updating Implementation Contracts

When you deploy a new version of an implementation contract, update the factory so all **future** markets use the new code. Existing markets are unaffected (their proxies point to the old implementation forever via EIP-1167).

### Step 1: Deploy the new implementation

Build and deploy the updated contract:

```bash
# Example: updating the AMM implementation
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features amm --release
cargo stylus deploy --features amm \
  --private-key $KEY --endpoint $RPC_URL --no-verify \
  --wasm-file target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/omnicurve_contracts.wasm \
  --max-fee-per-gas-gwei 0.1
```

Note the new implementation address from the output.

### Step 2: Update the factory's stored implementation address

The factory exposes owner-only setters for each implementation:

```bash
# Update AMM implementation
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "setAmmImplementation(address)" <NEW_AMM_IMPL> \
  --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Update Router implementation
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "setRouterImplementation(address)" <NEW_ROUTER_IMPL> \
  --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Update LP Token implementation
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "setLpTokenImplementation(address)" <NEW_LP_IMPL> \
  --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Step 3: Verify the update

```bash
cast call <FACTORY> "getAmmImplementation()(address)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call <FACTORY> "getRouterImplementation()(address)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call <FACTORY> "getLpTokenImplementation()(address)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

All subsequent `createMarket` calls will now clone the new implementations.

> **Important:** Existing market proxies are **immutable** — they will continue to delegate to the original implementation they were deployed with. EIP-1167 clones cannot be re-pointed. If you need to migrate an existing market, you must create a new one and migrate liquidity.

---

## Transferring Factory Ownership

The factory itself uses a two-step ownership transfer:

```bash
# Step 1: Current owner initiates transfer
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "transferOwnership(address)" <NEW_OWNER> \
  --private-key $CURRENT_OWNER_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Step 2: New owner accepts
cast send <FACTORY> \
  "acceptOwnership()" \
  --private-key $NEW_OWNER_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

---

## Verification Script

After deployment, verify all wiring is correct:

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh <FACTORY> <AMM_PROXY> <ROUTER_PROXY> <LP_PROXY>
```

This reads on-chain state and confirms:
- Factory implementation addresses are set
- AMM ↔ Router wiring is correct
- AMM → LP Token wiring is correct
- LP Token metadata (name, symbol, decimals, supply)
